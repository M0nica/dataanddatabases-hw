I loved this solution to dealing with the Nones in your data:

        output.append({'name': item[0],
        'altitude': float(item[1] or 0),
        'area': float(item[2] or 0),
        'type': item[3]})
        
I did notice that some of your output was different than Allison's -- is your Mondial database up to date? I think you mentioned that it was not, but your code looks correct!
